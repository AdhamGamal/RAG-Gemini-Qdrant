    "This project demonstrates how to build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**, **Qdrant** as a vector store, and **Google Gemini** as the LLM. It allows you to query knowledge from your own PDF documents, combining **retrieval** and **generation** in a clean, modular pipeline."
